Requirements of the project

1. Implement the basic logic of Gomoku and finish man-man game mode in the console without undo mode:
	i. A two array with 19 rows and 19 columns representing the 19*19 board with the default value of 0.
	ii. Update any array element by inputting the value (1 for black and -1 for white).
	iii.Once the array element is updated, restrict the array element to change for the whole game.
	iv. After every move, check if there are five stones in row vertically or horizontally or diagonally.
	v. If there are 5 stones in a row, end the game with the winner's name.
2. Build a graphic window using EasyX and design a good user interface.
3. Try to implement the undo feature.
4. Try to implement basic intelligent man-machine logic.
